Hooray, a new blog!

What happened to the last one, you may ask. Well, that's quite simple---I just
didn't feel super proud of it. If I was going to make another blog, I might
as well make it mine. In a fit of stupidity---something I'm quite prone to---I
just kinda deleted the last one, which meant a few posts got destroyed. That
wasn't my brightest move, but whatever---life goes on. It's not like I had the
next *Metamorphosis* in there or something.

This blog, unlike a few others I've had in the past, will be somewhat
restricted---a more *professional* blog where I talk about things relating to
physics, programming, music tech, and other things that are relevant to my 
work. This isn't to say that I don't have hobbies outside of my work of
course---I do plenty of things besides sit in my room and look at papers all
day---but that I just want to focus on my work. This is my *work* github, where
I talk about important things like *work*.

So, let's get started with this *very professional* blog---I got a few neat
ideas up my sleeve.
